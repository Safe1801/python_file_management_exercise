Access mode

The default value of mode argument is 'r' = read

Python Programs:

Symbol or Character

r - Open a file in read mode (default mode)


w


a - Open a file in append mode - Write data at the end of existing data Note: Creates a file if the named file dosen't exist.

r+ - Open a file for reading and writing both.


File operations:
read write , append

data=myFile.read(10)


#"if" you don't  want your program to read the file word by word try the readline function which read a single line until a delimiter is approached

    yield - produce or provide.



    'w' stands for writing so we opened a file in write mode and assigned it to a handle


    Again the write mode creates the required file if it doesn't exist and overwrites on the existing data if it does.

    we use the write() function and where we pass datatype , string in this case ,  


    write() writelines()


Rb Read a file in binary format.
Wb Write a file in binary format.
Ab Append in a file in binary format

Closing Files.

A brief discussion on Binary files

composed - sammansatt , lugn

relieved - lindrad, avl√∂sa,



if you want to get rid of closing files yourself,
    here's a newer method  of opening  files  which involves auto-closing of files.



auto closing files,  with keyword or statement.
